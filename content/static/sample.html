	<h2 class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

	<blockquote>Few cases present more interesting challenges than sex crime cases. The stakes are high, emotions are predominant, and the evidence is often nothing more than “he said/she said.” It is typical for the accused and the victim to be well acquainted, and questions of “motive” and “bias” are often key. Given Oregon’s rigid statutes regarding Jessica’s Law cases (Rape I, Sodomy I, and Unlawful Sexual Penetration I with a victim who is under 12 years old, all mandating 300 months in prison) and Ballot Measure 11 crimes (see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/137.700">ORS 137.700</a>), mandating prison sentences even for first-time offenders, representation is stressful. These cases are not for the faint of heart.

	Court-appointed counsel is not an option when an individual is not yet charged. Therefore, many will need advice from attorneys they may not keep once they are formally charged. Thankfully, with good direction and self-discipline, many who fear prosecution may actually escape it. They just need to understand the basics. You will help.

	<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Phone_Call_or_Email">The Phone Call or Email</span></h2>
<blockquote>When the phone rings and a person begins to describe a situation, ask yourself (and ultimately the caller) who needs my help most? Very often in these types of cases a spouse or relative will call to inquire. Family members may also want or need representation, so it is critical to identify at the outset who will be your client. Identify this, if possible, prior to scheduling the initial meeting.
</blockquote>
<p><b>Practice Tip – How to Begin the Initial Meeting</b>
</p><p>The person sitting in your waiting room (or having a consultation with you on the phone) is probably nervous, perhaps terrified, and fearful of the worst. This is true whether wrongly accused or not. The person may not know why the police left a business card. He or she may not know the purpose behind the unusual phone call or text they received from someone with whom they haven’t spoken in many months. But the good news is this person reached out to you in your capacity as an attorney. Now they can get good advice, process what is occurring, and plan how to make it to tomorrow and the next day and the next.
</p><p>Many times the client is accompanied by others—a spouse, a parent, a sibling, a friend or some combination of any of these supporting individuals. One of the striking differences between attorneys is how each chooses to deal with the competing and sometimes insistent needs of the client for (1) a privileged and confidential relationship with an attorney and (2) support and assistance from others close to them.
</p><p>Your most basic goal, even before helping, is first do no harm: Keep the attorney-client relationship intact by explaining at the outset the concepts of confidentiality and privileges, and advise your client about the need to speak privately. If the client arrives accompanied by one or more supporters, explain that they could be questioned about the advice you give the client if they are present when you discuss the facts of the case.
</p><p>My particular practice is to invite everyone into the office initially, discuss basic concepts including privilege and confidentiality, and gather information from the group while the client stays silent. The others can speak about what they “know” or believe or what they have been told or observed. The only exception is the client who should not speak in the presence of others at this juncture. This strategy also allows you to identify group dynamics, such as who naturally takes charge and who thinks before speaking. Once the others have said what they need to say, invite them to adjourn to the reception area and begin a discussion, in private, with the client.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Confidentiality"><b>Confidentiality</b></span></h2>
<blockquote>A communication with counsel is presumed confidential if the client intends for the communication to be confidential. However, if unnecessary third parties are present when the communication is made, the client and attorney may have difficulty later convincing the court that the communication was intended by the client to be a confidential communication. It is important for you to assist the client in maintaining confidentiality of their communications. Clarify that phone conversations within the state of Oregon, other than with counsel or other members of the defense team, are <i>not</i> presumed confidential (see more discussion of this below regarding pretext phone calls). Remind the client and others that if the client shares information with other people, including family and close friends, the client cannot have the expectation the information remains confidential. Those persons can be compelled to testify by the prosecution. That is why you will want to meet with the client alone when discussing his or her information about the case.
</blockquote>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Privileges"><b>Privileges</b></span></h2>
<blockquote>This is something you can discuss with the entire group in your office. Such a discussion can educate everyone about the importance of maintaining a relationship that is special and unassailable. The attorney-client privilege (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/40.225">ORS 40.225</a>/<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/40.225">ORE 503</a>) should be explained in part so others in the group will understand why they will be asked to leave the room during certain discussions. If the client arrives at your office alone, this same information will help him explain to others later why he can’t discuss the incident or fill them in on “what the lawyer says.”

The <i>privilege</i> in attorney-client privilege belongs to the client. Only she can waive it. And it is your duty to maintain it. Privileges are unusual creatures in that they are one of the few ways<br>
our system of laws protects something, whether it hampers the judicial process or not. Privileges are allowed a special place in our rules of evidence because they protect relationships deemed to be so important their existence trumps all else. Historically, privileges have strengthened and preserved relationships.

When applicable, discuss the “husband-wife privilege,” <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/40.255">ORS 40.255</a>/<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/40.255">ORE 505</a>, at the initial meeting. The privilege applies to those who are traditionally married and to partners in a civil union or domestic partnership. (See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/106.340">ORS 106.340(1)</a>.) The privilege is two-fold and protects confidential communications between spouses, as well as the right not to testify against one’s spouse. Remember that neither aspect of the privilege applies when one spouse is charged with a criminal offense against the other spouse, or a child of either spouse. In light of those circumstances, a recommendation for your client’s spouse to seek independent counsel if he or she is likely to be a witness or a person who would require “victim warnings” if charges are filed is good practice. And it is a good idea to have a short list of attorneys you trust and with whom you work well.

Department of Human Services (DHS) involvement is one clue that spousal privilege may not apply. Clarify the meaning of DHS’s actions. See the section below entitled, “The role of DHS and, therefore, our role,” for some additional information regarding the unique challenges DHS involvement brings.

If possible, determine at the initial conference whether your client is or has considered seeing a counselor or other treatment provider, where disclosure of the sex offense investigation would tend to arise. You may also urge the client to seek counseling related to the stress of the investigation. In these situations, you must identify what category of professional the client is seeing or wants to see, and advise the client about exceptions to privileged communications with that professional. See, e.g., <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/40.230">ORS 40.230/ORE 504</a> (Psychotherapist-Patient Privilege); <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/40.235">ORS 40.235/ORE 504-1</a> (Physician-Patient Privilege, which does not apply in criminal cases); <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/40.260">ORS 40.260/ORE 506</a> (Clergy-Penitent Privilege); <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/40.262">ORS 40.262/ORE 507</a> (Counselor-Client Privilege). Until you can accomplish that—which often cannot be done at the initial conference—instruct the client to not discuss the investigation or underlying facts even with a trusted professional. Reiterate to your client and others involved that minimizing the people who discuss your client’s predicament results in less rumors and fewer individuals on the state’s potential witness list.

Often, especially initially, you are expected to correctly navigate between competing needs—the need to stem the flow of information that could be harmful to your client versus the need for the client or others to receive professional help of a nonlegal nature. The client is unable to make an informed decision without your guidance about privileged relationships and the limits thereon.
</blockquote>
<p><b>Practice Tip</b>
</p><p>If possible, hire the expert, therapist, polygrapher, etc. through your firm and send them a letter of engagement which will bring them under the attorney-client privilege with the Accused. Pay that expert with a check from the firm and bill the amount back to the client. If experts are engaged in this manner then those individuals, and your client, can assert an attorney-client privilege.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Listen"><b>Listen</b></span></h2>
<p>You listen and you listen carefully. Clarify what you do not understand. Endeavor to reiterate what you think you are hearing or what you do not understand in order to get confirmation or correction. Most importantly, never forget that if you take detailed notes about statements made by anyone other than the client, you may need to turn those notes over in the future if the state charges your client, it proceeds to trial, and your notes have recorded statements that relate to the subject matter of your inquiry of that witness. Under <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/135.815">ORS 135.815</a>(1), a lawyer has an obligation to turn over all statements of witnesses, and so if the individuals with whom you are getting information and taking notes from become witnesses for the defense then, at a minimum, you would have to submit your notes to a judge <i>in camera</i> for the judge to decide which parts, if any, of your notes must be disclosed to the state.
</p><p>Again, if you allow the group to tell its story, ensure that the client remains silent. This is good practice for how the client should behave even after leaving your office. It may be uncomfortable for the client, but enforce the practice. To ease the tension, allow the client to take notes, so that she will remember issues or clarifications to later raise with you in a confidential environment. The listening portion is the time for you to get oriented to what the group understands or believes and how the group interacts.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ask.2C_Preserve.2C_Educate"><b>Ask, Preserve, Educate</b></span></h2>
<p>It can be difficult to know for certain what might be important before there are charges. But at this initial juncture, you may have the opportunity to obtain information that would otherwise be lost post-charge.
</p><p>Ask if there is electronic media that may be necessary to preserve right away. For example, is there something currently available on Facebook or other social media that could later be removed, be shut down, or become inaccessible? Are there emails or text messages that confirm the group’s understandings of bias, motive, intent, or consent? Now is the time to preserve those items. Photograph what you know could disappear and make other arrangements to preserve items over which your client cannot assure future control. Act immediately.
</p><p>Instruct the client and others to <i>not</i> use social media to communicate about the situation. In addition, the safest course is to instruct the client to eliminate public access to any social media accounts of his own, and arrange for your paralegal or an investigator to review those accounts for any potentially damaging—or helpful—information. You should anticipate that law enforcement may have already done this.
</p><p>Consider engaging an investigator. Instruct the investigator to interview others the client wishes to be involved and that you have identified as important to interview at this early phase. Your investigator can also help preserve evidence. In regards to the precharge investigation, it may be helpful to speak with the alleged victim or mutual acquaintances early in the process. However, be cognizant that once the alleged victim tells you not to initiate further contact, you are foreclosed. With that in mind, do not be hasty in your approach to the alleged victim.
</p><p>Other variables in precharge investigation may include social media, or more old-fashioned social evidence such as school yearbooks, which may be helpful for locating classmates. Consider requesting records from phone companies, schools, counselors, the military, and doctors. [For information on requesting military records, see OCDLA’s manual on veteran client representation, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://ocdla.force.com/Ocdla_Store_Item?id=a0w0a000006ucX2AAI"><i>Still at War: A Guide for Defenders, Prosecutors and Judges Dealing with Oregon’s Veteran Defendant Crisis</i></a>.] The client’s family and friends may be helpful in obtaining such information. But be aware that some information may be harmful and better left uncovered.
</p><p>In addition to any discussion of electronic media made with others present, you should discuss it again with your client in private. It is also important for the client to understand that police will likely obtain warrants to search electronic devices that may contain evidence of guilt or responsibility. Explain to the client the implications of such warrants to phones, computers, and items the client or others may think have been deleted. Of course, you cannot advise someone to destroy potential evidence (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/162.295">ORS 162.295</a>).
</p>
<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Alone_With_the_Client"><b>Alone With the Client</b></span></h1>
<p>The private client interview is the client’s chance to educate you. First, however, you must educate the client.
</p><p>Advise the client about the limits to the attorney-client relationship. Specifically, inform the client that if she admits something to you, she cannot later deny it to the jury on the witness stand. Explain that while you will never reveal confidential communications, you may be limited in your options in the future if the client admits to a fact they may later want to deny. Again, this is a<br>
very delicate juncture in the relationship between attorney and client, and attorneys have been known to navigate it in very different ways. You are balancing the need for the client to be able to speak freely in a protected setting while at the same time preventing the client from foreclosing future options.
</p><p>Sometimes individuals would rather know what the elements of a crime are and what defenses may exist before they go about discussing their own actions and awareness. Give the client the option to not disclose while giving the client the freedom to share everything. The goal is to allow your client to make informed decisions.
</p><p>Granted, few people seem to wish to take advantage of the option to conceal details from their attorney. But, clients need to know the options in order to make an informed choice.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Private_Polygraphs"><b>Private Polygraphs</b></span></h2>
<p>Polygraphs can end false allegations (and sometimes true allegations). The difficulty of undertaking a polygraph prior to a case being charged is that you may not know the relevant question.
</p><p>Assuming that you can ferret out the issue, a private polygraph can be powerful. Even if the client does not pass, early knowledge of that fact helps you develop a strategy for dealing with the relatively common request from law enforcement or the prosecutor for your client to “take a poly.” You must engage the polygrapher to maintain the confidentiality of the testing and results.
</p><p>Inform the client that polygraphs are unreliable tools. Unlike typical scientific instruments in which accurate measurement is presumed or typical, the ability of the polygraph to “measure” deception or truthfulness is nonexistent. Rather, the polygraph measures galvanic skin response, respiration, blood pressure, and heart rate, endeavoring to link increases and decreases to questions of deception and truthfulness.
</p><p>Polygraph results are inadmissible at trial, but favorable results may convince the state to drop pursuit of a case. You should discuss these considerations with the client.
</p><p>Because you cannot foresee the results of a polygraph, keep the fact that the client is taking a polygraph out of the consciousness of others. A negative polygraph, although unreliable evidence, may cause a client’s supporters to stop believing in the client. If others are unaware of the polygraph test, they will not seek the results. Thus, if possible, do not discuss the possibility of a polygraph with anyone other than the client, and explain to the client why she must keep the secret as well.
</p><p>When the client obtains favorable results from a polygraph, share that information with law enforcement if law enforcement is already conducting an investigation, or with the district attorney’s office if the investigation is complete and the matter is awaiting a charging decision. [For further discussion about the effective use of administering a polygraph test to your client, see Chapter 17, “Mititation, Negotiation and Sentencing,” by Thad Betz.]
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pretext_Communications"><b>Pretext Communications</b></span></h2>
<p>You must educate clients regarding anything that threatens their well-being. A pretext communication (phone call, text, or email) is one such threat. For the purpose of this discussion, we will limit the considerations to pretext phone calls.
</p><p>The pretext phone call usually involves the alleged victim (or a close family member or friend of the alleged victim) calling the client and asking the client to confirm certain parts of the alleged victim’s story. Because few people are at their sharpest when processing information through their auditory sense, pretext phone calls put clients at a disadvantage.
</p><p>Explain to the client that they need to be aware, ahead of time, of the possibility of receiving such a phone call. Explain alternatives for how the client handles this intended trap. Generic advice is inappropriate. The advice you provide the client should reflect the facts you know about the case. That said, the safest course is to instruct the client to let all suspect calls go to voicemail, and to not return calls from the alleged victim or known associates. If the client is caught unaware, a safe strategy is to immediately hang up. If the client is talking with anyone who begins to ask about the alleged victim or what happened, telling the caller those topics are off limits on advice of counsel is another safe strategy. Make sure the client knows to contact you immediately if any of these scenarios occur so you can provide advice regarding the next step.
</p><p>It may help the client follow your advice by educating them regarding the evidence code and our general inability to introduce the client’s out-of-court statements. In other words, the best pretext call dialogue from your client’s perspective may not be introduced because of OEC 801(3). Here’s an example:
</p><p>Alleged victim: “I just want you to admit that you loved me and that we had sex last year before you learned that I was only 13 years old.”
</p><p>Your client: “Now you know that isn’t true. We’ve never had sex.”
</p>
<blockquote>Your client’s out-of-court statement, offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, is hearsay if you seek to admit it. The state could seek admission under OEC 801(4)(b), but likely would not. Therefore, pretext calls almost never help a client, unless they are used to prevent the state from pursuing charges.

The most important message to impart in any discussion with the client about pretext calls should be that the client should work to maintain confidentiality and never communicate without thought and calculation, and without first conferring with you.
</blockquote>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Psychosexual_Evaluations_as_a_Preemptive_Tool">Psychosexual Evaluations as a Preemptive Tool</span></h2>
<blockquote>Psychosexual evaluations may be a useful tool. Understanding the issues and details of the case is crucial to an effective evaluation. Admittedly, it is rare that an evaluation will be the right strategic choice in the precharge stage. But if you understand the issues, time is on your side, the client is wanting to foreclose the possibility of prosecution, and you are certain that the client does not have anything harmful to share with the evaluator, an early-stage psychosexual evaluation may be an effective tool. An excellent, must-read on this topic is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.meryhewlaw.com/files/meryhew_hohman_pse_prep_march_2017_champion.pdf">“Preparing a Client for a Psychosexual Evaluation,”</a> from <i>The Champion</i>, in March, 2017.
</blockquote>
<p>Practice Tip
</p><p>These evaluations typically cost upwards of $2500. Most evaluators will want a confirmatory polygraph regarding your client’s non-offending sexual history. One strategy is to do the polygraph first, and if the client does not pass, reconsider whether it makes sense to go forward with the evaluation.
</p><p>When you direct your client to undergo a psychosexual evaluation, you must maintain the attorney-client privilege for the interaction. You do so by paying for the evaluator’s services, making you the client and the evaluator your agent. You should also reiterate to the client the pitfalls of incomplete privileges and the necessity for caution in counseling communications.
</p><p><i>You should also explain</i> “mandatory reporters” and what a psychologist or other mental health counselor may feel compelled to report. But note that once a “report of abuse” exists, a mandatory reporter need not make a duplicative report.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Clients.E2.80.99_Weaknesses"><b>Clients’ Weaknesses</b></span></h2>
<p>Perhaps nothing is more frustrating than the experience of meeting with a client, feeling as though everything is under control when they leave your office, only to learn a week later that the client was arrested on something unrelated.
</p><p>Drugs, alcohol, and pornography addictions are persistent traps for many clients. The thoughtful attorney should spend time discussing habitual or chronic behaviors with the client and the likelihood that they could lead to damning evidence in a case. For example, excessive alcohol consumption could lead to a regrettable slip of the tongue, or illegal pornography viewing could be discovered through search warrants of the client’s home, computer, or telephone.
</p><p>Help your client identify whether they would benefit from seeking help to manage addictions. The out-of-custody client has many opportunities to fall into behavior that will be used against them in a future case. Yes, incarcerated clients present fewer challenges in this area. With apologies to Janis Joplin, freedom is just another word for <i>everything</i> left to lose.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Police_Contact"><b>Police Contact</b></span></h2>
<p>Attorneys should advise clients about future police contact. Knowledge is power, especially in regards to sex crime allegations. Advice for potential sex-crime defendants might vary from advice in another case.
</p><p>There are two general schools of thought on strategy for a client’s response to police contact.<br>
One is that the client should never agree to speak with the police because the state’s case is made better any time a client speaks to the police. The other is that the client should leave open the possibility of speaking with police, after consulting with counsel. Wise attorneys will make an individual case assessment about which strategy to pursue, even though they usually favor one approach over the other.
</p><p>When the police come knocking, they have much more information than the client. Additionally, the police have the advantage of surprise in deciding when to contact the client. Because the client is generally not prepared for police arrival, numerous variables may play into the client’s poor interview. The client may be affected by lack of sleep or ingestion of drugs or alcohol. And the surprise police contact may create a feeling of vulnerability or fear, causing the client to defer to the police rather than maintaining her assertions. The police also have the advantage of fabrication, because nothing prohibits an officer from lying during suspect interrogation. The police may lie about what others have told them, causing the client to question whether friends and family have turned against her. The police advantages may overbear the client’s will, leading to incomplete statements or, worse, false confessions. All of this should be explained to the client.
</p><p>The second strategy for handling police contact is to advise the client to speak to police on your terms. While it is <i>imperative</i> that the client maintain not speaking with the police at the time and place of the police officers’ choosing, advise the client to say this:
</p><p>“I really want to be able to speak with you, but my attorney says she needs to speak with you first.
</p><p>“If you would give me your card, I will be sure to have my attorney call you and try to arrange our speaking.”
</p><p>This strategy has a few notable benefits. First, most people inherently want to speak with the police. They think openness and honesty will cause the police to react favorably. And they think it could clear up the (false) allegations. This strategy helps the client do what most people want to do, which is not say no to the police. Second, it allows the client to offer an alternative by suggesting they speak at a later time <i>once they are able to have the attorney arrange the interview</i>. Third, while this does not guarantee the police will not immediately arrest the client, it might encourage the police to wait because they want to conduct the investigative interview. Fourth, because the client has invoked his right to counsel, the police should not attempt to interrogate him. Fifth, it gives the attorney a shot at obtaining information from the police that is necessary to decide whether to agree to an interview. Sixth, this allows the attorney time to educate and prepare the client for the police interview, if that is determined to be the best choice.
</p><p>If you obtain adequate information from the investigating officer and the defense investigation determines that your client speaking with police is likely to be beneficial, and if you have confidence in the client’s ability to communicate clearly and effectively, you can schedule the police interview. Think about other preparations, such as obtaining a polygraph. When credibility is at issue, as it often is in sex crime cases, police often request suspects take polygraphs. Having favorable polygraph results already prepared eliminates that on-the-spot decision. Because the police are likely to request a polygraph at the conclusion of the interview, knowing your client will not pass may be a strong enough reason to not risk the interview.
</p><p>As discussed in the section on polygraphs above, it can be difficult to arrange a polygraph without knowing the salient question. However, once the police have made contact with the client and once you, the attorney, have made contact with the police, you can ascertain the salient question. Tell the police, “In trying to decide whether my client should agree to the interview, I need to have a good idea of what this is all about.” If the police want to be coy and say the client ought to know, tell the police that <i>you</i> need to be educated.
</p><p>Certainly, you and your client may decide <i>never</i> to meet with the police. That is perfectly fine. Denying the police interview at the initial police contact cannot hurt the client. Just as future denials to police requests cannot harm the client. The state cannot comment on a client’s right to silence during a trial. The client can comfortably maintain, “My attorney will not let me talk to you.”
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Clarify_in_Writing"><b>Clarify in Writing</b></span></h2>
<p>After completing the initial precharge interview with the client, it is advisable to communicate clearly what information the client should share (if any) and with whom. Repeat your discussion of confidentiality and privilege. Understand that the client may not want others to think they are being kept from having access to information. There are many ways the attorney can keep confidences and secrets and yet assist the client in helping others to feel part of the team.
</p><p>The best strategy is to put into writing the extent to which the client wants or does not want information disclosed with others. It is better to err on the side of strict limits because limits can be relaxed in the future, but oversharing cannot be taken back.
</p><p>Additionally, put into writing the client’s preferred method of receiving information from you. This can include phone contact, email contact, in-person contact, or written communication. In-person is the most secure, and email is often the least secure. However, many clients cannot imagine receiving written correspondence via mail and request email communications. When clients wish to receive communication via email, fully advise the client on the lack of confidential security in technology and obtain their written consent. Also, incorporate encrypted communications into your email practice.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_Role_of_DHS_.28And.2C_Therefore.2C_Your_Role.29"><b>The Role of DHS (And, Therefore, Your Role)</b></span></h2>
<p>There are sex crime cases that do not involve the Oregon Department of Human Services but they are rare. Therefore, this issue warrants significant coverage.
</p><p>There are numerous permutations that open the door to DHS involvement. The most typical fall into three categories:
</p><p>• The alleged victim is the child or step-child of the client and is under 18 years old.
</p><p>• Regardless of the alleged victim, the client has children under the age of 18 living in his or her home, and DHS can articulate a “risk of harm” to those children.
</p><p>• Regardless of the alleged victim, the client is the legal parent to a child under the age of 18 residing in the State of Oregon.
</p><p>If the client is the legal parent of any child (living in her home or not), DHS will want to contact the client to do a risk assessment interview, upon learning of the sex crime allegations. You should help the client decide whether to participate in that interview and if so to what extent. You should also help the client determine whether to request your presence during the interview. In most cases, attorney presence is advisable. Finally, you should help the client decide where she would prefer to do the interview. A good location for this meeting is in the family home since DHS will want to view the family home as part of the safety assessment.
</p><p>Risk assessment interviews may involve other individuals. For example, if the client is not the legal parent to involved children, the legal parents will be present. The statements from other individuals will likely impact the client’s future case.
</p><p>Prior to deciding how to respond to DHS, the client should identify his priorities. Below is a sample of goals that the client should rank in the order of importance:
</p><p>• Never register as a sex offender.
</p><p>• Keep the children’s lives as normal as possible.
</p><p>• Avoid incarceration.
</p><p>• Maintain the marriage.
</p><p>• Prevent the state from filing a criminal case.
</p><p>In addition to the importance of the client thinking about his priorities, this will also help you, the attorney, clarify which battles to focus your energy on and establish strategy.
</p><p>DHS will not investigate the truthfulness or lack thereof in a child victim’s statements. DHS takes children’s statements at face value. DHS caseworkers often say, “My job is to believe the child.” With that understanding, a client should know that she cannot convince DHS that a crime did not occur when it is her word versus a child’s. Rather, the focus during DHS interviews should be on providing appropriate responses when it comes to children remaining in the client’s home. There are a number of standard options:
</p><p>• The children remain but client leaves.
</p><p>• The children remain but there is a third party (usually the client’s spouse) who ensures that the children are never alone with the client.
</p><p>• The children leave and live with their other biological parent, another relative, or a family friend.
</p><p>• DHS does not worry about the safety of the children, because the “facts” about which the agency is aware do not give rise to a concern after minimal investigation.
</p><p>The client’s spouse, significant other, or the other parent of the children may need to hire an attorney to advise them on how they should handle interaction with DHS.
</p><p>DHS will make a determination as to whether a child’s claims are founded, unfounded, or unable to be determined. The child’s parents and the person alleged to have committed abuse will receive a letter informing them of the determination, which can be challenged. The challenge must be made within 30 days of receiving the letter articulating the determination.
</p><p>Ultimately, DHS’s final determination (after the agency process for review is complete) may be appealed to the circuit court by filing a petition for review of the agency determination. (See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/183.480">ORS 183.480</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/183.484">183.484</a>.) However, the standard upon judicial review is low: could a reasonable person, having the information that the agency has in its file, coupled with whatever evidence is produced at the hearing, have concluded that there was reasonable cause to believe that the client committed abuse or neglect? Very few such petitions are ever filed, partially due to the standard and also partially due to the cost of filing and having an attorney prepare for and conduct the hearing. The circuit court decision is final.
</p><p>Inform the client about the impact of a “founded for abuse” DHS determination. Such impacts include the client’s future inability to work in a daycare facility, be approved for in-home care of a relative, or obtain professional licenses in healthcare or public safety.
</p><p>“Founded,” “unfounded,” or “unable to determine” determinations could spell the end of DHS involvement. If DHS concludes that the child or children are not at risk of abuse in the future, because they are in the custody of a protective parent, you may not hear from DHS again.
</p><p>However, if DHS determines that the “condition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare of the child (person under 18 years old) or others,” the agency may file a juvenile dependency petition under <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/419B.100">ORS 419B.100</a>. ORS 419B.100(2) provides, “[t]he court shall have jurisdiction under subsection (1) of this section even though the child is receiving adequate care from the person having physical custody of the child.” Therefore this can be a natural time to discuss juvenile dependency petitions, applicable laws, and how to proceed with the client.
</p><p>Speak to the client alone about those issues and understand the client’s priorities and preferences. It is critical to avoid any conflicts of interest and to recommend that a spouse or parent of an alleged child victim receive independent advice from a different attorney. Your client’s priorities may not be the same as others’ priorities. Things that the other parent does or says in the early stages of DHS involvement are extremely predictive of the ultimate outcome of a juvenile dependency case. Sometimes it is important for spouses or adults to choose at this point in time to create a physical distance in order to assure DHS that an adult is picking the safety and well-being of a child over that of your client. Again, these are not decisions that you, alone, make. These decisions belong to the parents and guardians of the involved child or children.
</p><p>Also note that this chapter of the Oregon Revised Statutes provides, “rape, sodomy or sex abuse of any child by the parent” can be deemed “extreme conduct” under <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/419B.502">ORS 419B.502</a> and lead to the termination of parental rights. “In such cases, no efforts need to be made by available social agencies to help the parent adjust the conduct in order to make it possible for the child or ward to safely return home within a reasonable amount of time.”

<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Involving_Others"><b>Involving Others</b></span></h1>
<p>In the time that you conducted a private initial interview with the client, the client’s friends and family may have been sitting in your waiting room, likely thinking of questions. Invite them to your office after the client interview and answer what you can, so long as the questions are not going to create a conflict of interest or reveal confidential and privileged information. Additionally, the client may need your help in telling the group what the client has shared. You should have already discussed, as recommended above, what the client should share and with whom. This is a great part of the art of advocacy – understanding what should and should not be shared. There are no general practice tips that can guide you here. Your common sense, experience, and gut will guide you. Also, do not hesitate to call and ask advice from another experienced attorney. And, when in doubt, keep quiet.
</p><p>The main goal in meeting again with other individuals is twofold:
</p><p>• Get ideas regarding any investigator tasks, information gathering, or preservation that should occur.
</p><p>• Obtain assistance in dealing with drug/alcohol/pornography addictions or mental health concerns that require medication or watchfulness (such as thoughts of suicide).
</p><p>Discuss with the group what to do when and if the police make contact, reinforcing previously discussed issues with the client.
</p><p>If relevant, discuss the role of DHS with the client’s chosen friends or family. Describe the inherent conflicts DHS involvement creates. Remind them about the need for you to act as the attorney for only one client. Encourage each parent of an involved child to obtain independent counsel.
</p><p>Reinforce the importance of the friends’ and family’s support, encouraging the client’s group to contact you with any questions or concerns.

</p><p>Research your local court’s typical position on bail and release conditions. Talk with the client’s family and friends about the possibility of arrest and what to expect in terms of bail and release. Help the client formulate a response plan, e.g., the best person to call from jail, warnings that all jail calls and other communications will be recorded and turned over to police, the need to alert intake staff to any medical issues and necessary medication, and what to tell the client’s employer.
</p><p>Certainly the goal when meeting with the client precharge is to never arrive at the stage of a charge or arrest. But the reality is that approximately one in three people who seek legal advice prior to being charged attain that goal. Still, preparation for police interviews and pretext communications as well as positive polygraph results and other proactive investigation can help to increase the likelihood of avoiding charges. The key to success is preparation and understanding throughout. That does not cease at arrest. Thus, a detailed discussion about what to expect for arrest and the client’s options for release and bail is imperative.

</p><p>In discussing these with the client, try not to add additional stress or cloud their judgment. But do not underplay the high stakes. The client needs from the outset to have a realistic understanding of the potential results of a guilty finding. By sharing such information in your initial meeting, you help insure that the client will follow your advice and not be careless.
</p>
<h1><span class="mw-headline" id="Next_Steps"><b>Next Steps</b></span></h1>
<p>After the initial precharge meeting follow up on strategies discussed—schedule polygraphs, police interviews, support services, and investigation. But remember to use care and thought in all of that. Remember, sometimes it is best not to uncover evidence. Regardless, before doing any of
that, consider providing written notice to the police and the prosecutor’s office that you represent the client.
</p><p>This is important to prevent unwanted direct contact by police. You may decide against providing notice if you are certain the client can confidently handle police contact and you and the client agree it is strategically better for law enforcement to believe the client is unaware of the potential for criminal charges. There are some circumstances in which you and/or the client will determine that sending notice of representation may do more harm than good. If that is not the determination, however, put others on notice of representation and the fact that they are not permitted to speak with client without going through you. Some district attorneys are willing to commit to no arrest of the client without prior notification to you, though this is simply a courtesy and not a requirement. Decide if open lines of communication are warranted at this juncture and, if so, open them up.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Confirmation_That_Charges_Will_Not_Be_Filed"><b>Confirmation That Charges Will Not Be Filed</b></span></h2>
<p>If this initial goal is met, your client is in the clear. But remember to address whether to expunge any arrests or request return of any posted bail. Then, write a closeout letter to the client, return any money remaining in trust, and congratulate yourself on a job well done.
