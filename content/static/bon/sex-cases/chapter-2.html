<p>Subsection (5) of ORS 135.240 reads:
</p><p>(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court shall set a security amount of not less than $50,000 for a defendant charged with an offense listed in ORS 137.700 or 137.707 unless the court determines that amount to be unconstitutionally excessive, and may not release the defendant on any form of release other than a security release if:
</p><p>(A) The United States Constitution or the Oregon Constitution prohibits the denial of release under subsection (4) of this section;
</p><p>(B) The court determines that the defendant is eligible for release under subsection (4) of this section; or
</p><p>(C) The court finds that the offense is not a violent felony.
</p><p>(b) In addition to the security amount described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the court may impose any supervisory conditions deemed necessary for the protection of the victim and the community. When a defendant who has been released violates a condition of release and the violation:
</p><p>(A) Constitutes a new criminal offense, the court shall cause the defendant to be taken back into custody, shall order the defendant held pending trial and shall set a security amount of not less than $250,000.
</p><p>(B) Does not constitute a new criminal offense, the court may order the defendant to be taken back into custody, may order the defendant held pending trial and may set a security amount of not less than $250,000.
</p><p>On its face ORS 135.240 prohibits a bail amount of less than $50,000. However, the Oregon Supreme Court has interpreted the statute in such a way as to permit the trial court to lower bail to an amount affordable for the accused. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1798349884163452981&amp;q=State+v.+Sutherland,+329+OR+359+(1999&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38"><i>State v. Sutherland</i></a>, 329 Or 359 (1999). <i>Sutherland</i> recognizes that the Oregon Constitution grants most accused persons a constitutional right to bail. <i>Id</i>., citing <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6570602024455720030&amp;q=Hanson+v.+Gladden,+246+OR+494++(1967&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38"><i>Hanson v. Gladden</i></a>, 246 Or 494 (1967). While upholding the statute because “circumstances exist in which applying the statute would not violate either constitution,” the <i>Sutherland</i> court held:
</p><p>Because a source of law [providing for the right to a hearing regarding “as applied” challenges to bail amounts] is a constitutional one, ORS 135.240(5) is subordinate. Therefore, the $50,000 specified by that statute as the minimum amount that “shall” be imposed must be read as the minimum amount that is to be imposed initially, on arrest. Thereafter, defendant may request a hearing for the purposes of establishing that, as to him or her, requiring that or a higher amount as security is constitutionally impermissible. If defendant requests such a hearing, he or she must be given the opportunity to demonstrate that, as to that defendant, the statutory amount is “excessive” and, if that determination is made, to have the court set some lesser amount that is not excessive.
</p><p><i>Sutherland</i> at 329 Or at 367.
</p><p>Thus, despite a statutory “floor” of $50,000 bail (and $250,000 in various counties as regular practice), the Oregon Constitution via <i>Sutherland</i> acts as a backstop to excessive bail and demands an “individualized hearing” addressing whether or not the statutory bail is “excessive.”
</p><p>Factors the trial courts should consider when affixing the amount of bail have long been summarized by Oregon courts. Many trial courts when facing a <i>Sutherland</i> motion simply adopt the factors outlined in Ch. 135.230 (“primary” and “secondary release criteria”). Primary release criteria include reasonable protection of victim and public, nature of the current charge, accused’s prior criminal record, accused’s prior record of appearance if released previously, any facts indicating possibility of violations of law if accused is release without regulations, and any other facts that indicate whether or not the defendant is likely to appear. “Secondary release criteria” include employment status, financial condition, family relationships of accused, past and present residences, whether or not additional people can assist the accused in attending court, and any other facts indicating a strong bond of the accused and the community.
</p><p>Additional authority for factors that courts should consider can be found in an older Oregon Supreme Court case:
</p><p>The courts have indicated certain factors that should be taken into consideration in fixing bail. These are: (1) ability of the accused to give bail, (2) nature of the offense, (3) penalty for the offense charged, (4) character and reputation of the accused, (5) health of the accused, (6) character and strength of the evidence, (7) probability of the accused appearing at trial, (8) forfeiture of other bonds, (9) whether the accused was under bond in other cases, and (10) whether the accused was a fugitive from justice when arrested.

Denial of Bail to a Violent Felon">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="II._Denial_of_Bail_to_a_Violent_Felon"><b>II. Denial of Bail to a Violent Felon</b></span></h1>
<p>Casting aside constitutional issues presented by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/135.240">ORS 135.240</a>(5), there exists a separate problem for bail of an accused charged with “violent felonies.” ORS 135.240(5) states that the term “violent felonies” includes any “felony sex crime.”
</p><p>ORS 135.240(4) recites that an accused charged with a violent felony shall be denied release (including bail) if the court finds:
</p><p>(a) probable cause that the defendant committed the offense and
</p><p>(b) by clear and convincing evidence, that the there is a danger of physical injury or sexual victimization to the victim or members of the public by the defendant while on release.
</p><p>An accused is entitled to a hearing on the matter but “must request the hearing at the time of arraignment,” which then must be held within five days. Notably, and different from Subsection (5), the state has the burden to prove the denial of bail standard.
</p><p>The constitutional permission for this statute is found in the panoply of victim’s rights amendments—Article I, section 43. Certainly, prior to this amendment, the violent felony restriction of bail runs afoul of Article I, sections 14 and 16.
</p><p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5741581181224640770&amp;q=United+States+v.+Salerno,+481+U.S.+739+(1984&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,38"><i>United States v. Salerno</i></a>, 481 U.S. 739 (1984), provides a potential due process and Eighth Amendment challenge to 135.240(5). The <i><span class="underline">Salerno</span></i> Court held that the Federal Bail Reform Act, which did away with bail in the federal system, did not violate due process and the Eighth Amendment. In doing so, the Court paid close attention to the statutory structure of the act. For instance, a court can only deny release after an adversarial hearing involving a detailed proffer of evidence and the court’s finding that <i>no</i> combination of conditions of release “can reasonably assure the safety of the community or any person.” <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3142">18 USC § 3142</a>(f). The act also has enumerated factors to consider such as the nature and seriousness of the offense, the history of the accused, and the substantiality of government evidence. Moreover, detention is limited by the federal speedy trial statute and the reviewability of the magistrate’s decision before another judge where the defense can present new evidence:
</p><p>Under the Bail Reform Act, the procedures by which a judicial officer evaluates the likelihood of future dangerousness are specifically designed to further the accuracy of that determination. Detainees have a right to counsel at the detention hearing. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f). They may testify in their own behalf, present information by proffer or otherwise, and cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing. <i>Ibid.</i> The judicial officer charged with the responsibility of determining the appropriateness of detention is guided by statutorily enumerated factors, which include the nature and the circumstances of the charges, the weight of the evidence, the history and characteristics of the putative offender, *752 and the danger to the community. § 3142(g). The Government must prove its case by clear and convincing evidence. § 3142(f). Finally, the judicial officer must include written findings of fact and a written statement of reasons for a decision to detain. § 3142(i). The Act’s review provisions, § 3145(c), provide for immediate appellate review of the detention decision.
</p><p><i>Salerno</i>, 481 U.S. at 751-52, 107 S. Ct. at 2104.
</p><p>When faced with a prosecutor’s motion to hold an accused without bail, counsel should press the Oregon courts to adopt the detailed procedures and standards outlined in <i>Salerno</i> and that failing to do so violates the Eighth Amendment and the Due Process clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Most notably, the level of review appears to be strikingly inadequate in the Oregon structure if bail is denied. <i>See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4938462416013017008&amp;q=State+v.+Keller,+240+Or+442+(1965&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38">State v. Keller</a></i>, 240 Or 442 (1965) (reiterating that bail is only reviewed as “abuse of discretion”).

<p>Not all of the news on bail and release is bad. Many sex offenses are not Measure 11 crimes, or violent felonies and simply are “releasable Offenses” under 135.240. Under that statute, the defendant “shall be released in accordance with ORS 135.230 to ORS 135.290.” “Release upon personal recognizance is the legislatively preferred type of release”. ORS&nbsp;135.245(3). <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5360620284320122979&amp;q=State+ex+rel.+Lowrey+v.+Merryman,+296+Or+254,++674+P2d+1173,+1175+(1984&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38"><i>State ex rel. Lowrey v.

</p><p>Therefore, on all sex offenses that do not require a minimum bail or are considered a violent felony every practitioner should advocate for personal recognizance as there is a presumption of that release <i>unless</i> the magistrate when making the “release decision”<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> finds that the primary release criteria require a different result.
</p><p>The primary release criteria are found in ORS 135. 230(7) and are as follows:
</p><p>(a) The reasonable protection of the victim or public;
</p><p>(b) The nature of the current charge;
</p><p>(c) The defendant’s prior criminal record, if any, and, if the defendant previously has been released pending trial, whether the defendant appeared as required;
</p><p>(d) Any facts indicating the possibility of violations of law if the defendant is released without regulations;&nbsp;and
</p><p>(e) Any other facts tending to indicate that the defendant is likely to appear.

<h1><span class="editsection">[<a href="/index.php?title=Defending_Sex_Cases/Chapter_2&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: IV. Evidence to Win a Bail Hearing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="IV._Evidence_to_Win_a_Bail_Hearing"><b>IV. Evidence to Win a Bail Hearing</b></span></h1>
<blockquote>Whether operating under a Measure 11 bail minimum of subsection (5) or an attempt by the state to deny bail under subsection (4), or forcing the magistrate to release your client on their own personal recognizance, a practitioner should prepare to locate the following types of evidence.

First, since the court will know nothing about your client outside what police reports summarize or an officer testifies to, clients are best served by counsel subpoenaing or having present, to the extent possible, members of the community who can attest to the client’s ability to maintain law abiding conduct and good character in general. Classes of witnesses can include family, friends, employers, clergy, mentors, etc. Be prepared to present evidence, declarations, and information concerning the primary and secondary release criteria.

Second, counsel should be prepared to offer “shield evidence.” In other words, what measures can be put in place, which are less restrictive than confinement, to ameliorate risk of similar behavior? If your client is charged with a child sex offense, what measures can be put in place to prevent unmonitored contact with minors? Can a GPS monitor be affixed? If alcohol played a role in the offense, can an electronic monitor or portable breathalyzer be used? Larger counties have release officers with whom you can communicate about these measures. In smaller counties the probation department can often share resources.

Third, with respect to the amount of bail, counsel should be prepared to offer (lack of) asset evidence. As the rules of evidence do not apply to these proceedings (OEC 101), an accused should never take the stand in this scenario. Rather, counsel or an investigator can prepare affidavits that they have reviewed asset evidence and bail is not possible in the amounts proscribed by subsection (5).

<p>Practice Tips
</p><p>(if your client or his family has money)
</p><p><b>Posting Security:</b>
</p><p>Posting security can be stressful for the accused, his or her family and/or supporters. There are two basic ways to post security. The first way is to have it posted by a family member/supporter. The security required is ten percent of the amount stated (so the person would be required to post $1,000 on a $10,000 bail). The downside is that the person posting is then “on the hook” for the remaining ninety percent <i><span class="underline">if</span></i> the accused fails to live up to the terms and conditions of release and does not come to court. If the accused does come to court and is convicted, all fines, fees, restitution, and a fifteen percent handling fee will be deducted from the posted amount before the remaining balance, if any, is returned to the person posting.
</p><p>The second way is to put the money in your client’s account at the jail (“books”) and then the client can self-bail. If client fails to show for court, then client (not supporters or family members) is “on the hook” for the ninety percent balance. Same rules apply (i.e., if the accused does come to court and is convicted, all fines, fees, restitution, as well as a fifteen percent handling fee will be deducted from the posted amount before the remaining balance, if any, is returned to the person posting, in this case the client. Therefore the money will not go to the person(s) who originally put up the security for client to “self-bail.”
</p><p>As to posting, always remember that each jail is different but one universal rule seems to be that if the person bringing the security to the jail brings it in the form of a cashier’s check, that person must have the business card of the bank representative who issued it (or better yet the branch supervisor) and get the cashier’s check to the jail during banking hours because the jail will not accept it unless they get verbal clearance from the bank.
</p><p>Two other practical tips are: 1) if your client gets arrested and posts bail, always seek a reduction in that security posted—the less available, the less that can be immediately taken to cover fines, fees, restitution, etc. (cite to cases here) and 2) if your client is arrested, posts security and the case is initially no-complainted, file a short motion (generally ex-parte with presiding) to have the full amount posted returned and save your client the fifteen. It does not always work but it can be granted.

<p>When your client is charged with a sex crime, representation begins well before trial. It is imperative to consider your client’s options for pretrial release, to understand your role in requesting it, and to realize and communicate your chance of obtaining it.
