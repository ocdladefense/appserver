<p>Obviously the stakes are much higher when your client is facing a felony DUII charge. In these cases, your client has much more at risk, including the potential for prison time, a lifetime driver’s license revocation, and being labeled a “Felon.” Before representing someone facing this criminal charge, familiarize yourself with the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission’s Sentencing Guidelines Rules and consult experienced practitioners who have tried these cases before. The facts, aside from the prior convictions, will be like every other misdemeanor DUII case you have defended before. Do not let the label of “felony DUII” deter you from the case. There are many ways to effectively defend and attack felony DUII cases. Some of the methods are listed below. 
</p>

<p>Created in 1999, the Oregon Legislature established the crime of felony DUII. When HB 2002 passed, it created subsection 813.010 (5) which states:
</p><p>“Driving while under the influence of intoxicants is a class C felony if the defendant has been convicted of driving under the influence of intoxicants in violation of this section or its statutory counterpart in another jurisdiction at least three times in the 10 years prior to the date of the current offense and the current offense was committed in a motor vehicle. For purposes of this subsection, a prior conviction for boating while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/lawsstatutes/2013ors830.html">ORS 830.325</a> or its statutory counterpart in another jurisdiction, or for prohibited operation of an aircraft in violation of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/lawsstatutes/2013ors837.html">ORS 837.080(1)(a)</a> or its statutory counterpart in another jurisdiction, shall be considered a prior conviction of driving while under the influence of intoxicants.”
</p><p>Next, in 2007 the legislature completely reorganized the statute and included “controlled substances, inhalants or any combination thereof” as part of the crime and moved to exclude convictions for minors where the conviction was based on their BAC being below the normal permissible limit for their jurisdiction (which is not a crime in Oregon as impairment must still be shown):
</p><p>“(b) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this subsection, a conviction for a driving offense in another jurisdiction based solely on a person under 21 years of age having a blood alcohol content that is lower than the permissible blood alcohol content in that jurisdiction for a person 21 years of age or older does not constitute a prior conviction.”
</p><p>Finally, in 2009 the legislature put language back into the crime for defendants who have “been convicted of, or been found to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court for an act that if committed by an adult would be [a DUII].” This language allows some juvenile adjudications to be counted as a prior conviction. 
</p><p><b>Note:</b> It has become the practice of many district attorneys offices in Oregon that for persons ages 15, 16 and 17 who commit traffic misdemeanor offenses (e.g., DUII’s, Reckless Driving), the case is remanded to adult/circuit court for prosecution and the juvenile court system is bypassed entirely.
</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/index.php?title=DUII_Trial_Notebook:Chapter_1_The_Defense&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: B.

<p>In 2011 the Oregon Legislature made a major change to felony DUII cases and created ORS 813.011. The statute reads as follows: 
</p><p>(1) Driving under the influence of intoxicants under ORS 813.010 (Driving under the influence of intoxicants) shall be a Class C felony if the defendant has been convicted of driving under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010 (Driving under the influence of intoxicants), or its statutory counterpart in another jurisdiction, at least two times in the 10 years prior to the date of the current offense.
(2) Once a person has been sentenced for a Class C felony under this section, the 10-year time limitation is eliminated and any subsequent episode of driving under the influence of intoxicants shall be a Class C felony regardless of the amount of time which intervenes.
(3) Upon conviction for a Class C felony under this section, the person shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of incarceration of 90 days, without reduction for any reason.
</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/index.php?title=DUII_Trial_Notebook:Chapter_1_The_Defense&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: C.

<p>Most obviously; ORS 813.010 (5) requires three prior convictions when ORS 813.011 only requires two prior convictions. 
</p><p>ORS 813.010 (5) requires that the current crime be a motor vehicle (defined in ORS 801.360) whereas ORS 813.011 being similar to the rest of the DUII statutes only requires a vehicle (ORS 801.590). However, under either statute the prior conviction crimes can include Boating Under the Influence, Pedaling Under the Influence or other variations as a prior conviction in Oregon or another jurisdiction.

<p>One of the most important things counsel can do for a felony DUII defendant is to exclude, suppress, or otherwise nullify the prior conviction so those priors are no longer an element of the felony DUII. For purposes of the current DUII charge being a felony, the prior convictions are measured from the date of <i>conviction</i> of the priors to the date of <i>incident</i> on the current charge. 
</p><p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/lawsstatutes/2013ors136.html">ORS 136.434</a> and ORS 813.328 are the two guidelines. Counsel should familiarize themselves with these statutes and the subsequent case law before moving forward.
</p><p><b>Note</b>: ORS 813.328 (1) A defendant who challenges the validity of prior convictions alleged by the state as an element of felony driving while under the influence of intoxicants must give notice of the intent to challenge the validity of the prior convictions at least<b> seven days prior to the first date set for trial </b>on the felony charge. [See Appendix A] (First Date = First Trial Setting).
</p><p><b>1. Validity of a Prior Conviction</b>
To be used as an element of the crime of DUII, each prior conviction must meet the Oregon standard for a valid conviction. Although uncounseled pleas are becoming far less frequent, they still occur. Under <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=McKenzie,+195+Or+App+318+%282004&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=13669159485185433252&amp;scilh=0">McKenzie</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=McKenzie,+195+Or+App+318+%282004&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=13669159485185433252&amp;scilh=0">, 195 Or App 318 (2004)</a>, the Court of Appeals found that Oregon law requires that “an uncounseled guilty plea be preceded by a knowing waiver of counsel that is based on an awareness by the defendant of the risks of self-representation.” In Oregon, under <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Meyrick,+313+Or+125+%281992%29,+&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=3868546510032013217&amp;scilh=0">Meyrick</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Meyrick,+313+Or+125+%281992%29,+&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=3868546510032013217&amp;scilh=0">, 313 Or 125 (1992)</a><i>,</i> and later <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Reed,+247+Or+App+155+%282011&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=13096057346249394218&amp;scilh=0">Reed</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Reed,+247+Or+App+155+%282011&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=13096057346249394218&amp;scilh=0">, 247 Or App 155 (2011)</a>, the courts have established that a presumption of a validity exists as to a judgment which was unappealed, or has become final after appeal.

</p><p><b>2. Other Jurisdictions</b>
Any out-of-state prior conviction must meet the same requirements of a “statutory counterpart” to Oregon’s DUII to be counted as a prior conviction. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Ortiz,+202+Or+App+695+%282005%29&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=15492066100522438572&amp;scilh=0">Ortiz</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Ortiz,+202+Or+App+695+%282005%29&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=15492066100522438572&amp;scilh=0">, 202 Or App 695 (2005)</a>.

Courts have been notoriously broad when interpreting a “statutory counterpart” to Oregon’s ORS 813.010. The counterpart requirement is met if the crimes are “remarkably similar or have same use, role or characteristics.” <i>Mersman</i>, supra. This would typically exclude convictions for “wet reckless” or other such crimes. 
</p><p><b>3. Other Considerations</b>
</p><p>Violations, as opposed to crime’s should not be considered convictions for purposes of felony DUII elements as they do not fit the “statutory counterpart” of the DUII in Oregon, nor the preponderance standard inherent in any violation. 
</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/index.php?title=DUII_Trial_Notebook:Chapter_1_The_Defense&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: B. Negotiating a Misdemeanor">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="B._Negotiating_a_Misdemeanor">B. Negotiating a Misdemeanor</span></h3>
<p>Pursuant to ORS 813.170, the defendant may not plead guilty to another offense when they are charged with DUII. What this statute does <i>not</i> say is that a defendant may not plea to a misdemeanor DUII when they have been charged with a felony DUII. Some of the factors that prosecutors will look for include age of the prior convictions, relative criminal history, success in treatment, high risk driver’s courses, etc. Although it can be very difficult, use all these positive factors to help negotiate the misdemeanor DUII. 
</p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/index.php?title=DUII_Trial_Notebook:Chapter_1_The_Defense&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: IV. Trial">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="IV._Trial"><b>IV. Trial</b></span></h2>
<p>The elements of a felony DUII trial will be identical to the elements in a misdemeanor DUII trial. The state will still be required to prove the same elements with one additional requirement, the prior convictions. If counsel is unable to exclude, suppress, or otherwise nullify the prior conviction, be prepared to either stipulate or face their existence head-on with the jury. 
</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/index.php?title=DUII_Trial_Notebook:Chapter_1_The_Defense&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11" title="Edit section: A. To Stipulate or Not to Stipulate">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="A._To_Stipulate_or_Not_to_Stipulate">A. To Stipulate or Not to Stipulate</span></h3>
<p>If the defendant does not stipulate to the existence of prior convictions pursuant to ORS 813.326 (3), the prosecutor will be required to prove them beyond a reasonable doubt. The most common way is via certified copies of the judgment presented to the jury pursuant to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/40.510">OEC 902</a>. These judgments will be admitted and allowed for the jury to consider. With prior convictions admitted and under consideration by the jury, the defense of your case just became far more difficult. 
</p><p>The best course of action for a Felony DUII is to stipulate to the prior convictions under ORS 813.326 (3), thereby excluding this evidence from the consideration of the jury. There will still be a twelve member jury empaneled, however the jury will not be advised that this is a felony case, nor will they be advised of the prior convictions unless and until a guilty verdict is reached. If the defendant has stipulated to the priors and is convicted by the jury, arguments that can be made regarding the validity of those prior convictions are limited at that point. 
</p><p><b>Note:</b> All arguments regarding pretrial admissibility and validity of the prior convictions should have already been litigated, but objection (outside the presence of the jury) should be made for purposes of appeal (see Section III). Look at any documents carefully – only a final judgment of conviction is sufficient to prove the existence of the prior beyond a reasonable doubt. Beware of certified copies of dockets, summary letters from clerks of court, plea petitions, charging documents and other documents that are not final judgments of conviction<i>.</i>

Elements of Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicants</span></h3>
<p>The state must prove that the defendant was:
</p><p>1) driving a vehicle, 
2) upon premises open to the public,
3) driving occurred within the jurisdiction of the court,
4) blood alcohol content of .08% as shown by chemical analysis, and/or was 
5) under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and/or a controlled substance, and/or an inhalant. 
</p><p><b>1. Driving a Vehicle</b> 
</p><p>a. Although the term “drives” is not defined under 813.010, the word is “construed as requiring that the vehicle be in motion in order for the offense to be committed.” <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Minow,+246+Or+App+179,++%282011&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=9708850174613394981&amp;scilh=0">State v. Minow</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Minow,+246+Or+App+179,++%282011&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=9708850174613394981&amp;scilh=0">, 246 Or App 179, 184-185 (2011)</a>. The terms “drives” (ORS 813.010) and “operates” (ORS 813.100) are synonymous. The term “operation” is defined in ORS 801.370 as “any operation, towing, pushing, movement or otherwise propelling.” Nothing indicates that this definition not be applied in the context of DUII. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Cruz,+121+Or+App+241,+%281993&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=14465753892105674362&amp;scilh=0">State v.

</p><p>b. Driving can be inferred from the circumstances. While having the engine running does not constitute “driving” under the statute, a jury could reasonably infer that the defendant drove to that location. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Bilsborrow,+230+Or+App+413,++%282009&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=15253499888490603167&amp;scilh=0">State v.

</p><p><b>2. Upon Premises Open to the Public</b>
</p><p>a.“Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the offense described in this section, driving while under the influence of intoxicants, is a Class A misdemeanor and is applicable upon any premises open to the public.” ORS 813.010(4).
</p><p>b.<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/lawsstatutes/2013ors801.html">ORS 801.400</a> defines “premises open to the public” to include “any premises open to the general public for the use of motor vehicles, whether the premises are publicly or privately owned and whether or not a fee is charged for the use of the premises.” The term “premises open to the public” should be defined so as to achieve its primary purposes, which is to protect members of the public from serious driving offenses. <i>See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Sterling,+196+Or+App+626,&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=9788496937939821256&amp;scilh=0">State v.

</p><p><b>3. Driving Occurred Within the Jurisdiction of the Court</b>
</p><p>a. The state has the burden of establishing that the defendant drove a vehicle within the jurisdiction of the court in its case in chief. “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right to public trial by an impartial jury in the county in which the offense shall have been committed…” Article I, section 1, Oregon Constitution. 
</p><p>b.Jurisdiction lies where there is proof that defendant drove within one mile of the county line. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+McCown,+113+Or+App+627,+&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=11575079132484412470&amp;scilh=0">State v.

This does not violate Article I, section 11; but note that non-criminal traffic offenses are governed by a separate statute (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/lawsstatutes/2013ors153.html">ORS 153.570</a>). 
</p><p>c. If the state fails to establish jurisdiction, the proper action is to move for judgment of acquittal. Failure to move for judgment of acquittal waives a defendant’s appellate claim that the state failed to establish venue. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Maestas,+&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=18086622996632920743&amp;scilh=0">State v.

</p><p><b>4. Blood Alcohol Content of .08 Percent as Shown by Chemical Analysis</b>
</p><p>a. The prosecution may show a defendant committed the offense of driving under the influence of intoxicants by proving the defendant drove with a blood alcohol content of .08% or higher as shown by chemical analysis. ORS 813.010(1)(a). The prosecution may also prove the defendant violated the statute by driving under the influence of intoxicants. ORS 813.010(1)(b)-(c).
</p><p>b.The relevant point in time for a defendant’s blood alcohol content is the time of driving, not the time of the breath or blood test. Retrograde extrapolation may be used to show a defendant’s blood alcohol content at the time they were driving. The Oregon Supreme Court explicitly finds that an expert may project backwards from blood alcohol content at the time of a breath or blood test, to the likely blood alcohol content at the time of the driving. An expert may testify about the rate of dissipation through retrograde extrapolation. <i>See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Eumana-Moranchel,+352+Or+1+%282012&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=15333483509637516862&amp;scilh=0">State v.

</p><p><b>5. Under the Influence of Intoxicants</b> 
</p><p>a. The prosecution may show a defendant violated the DUII statute by proving they were under the influence of an intoxicating liquor, a controlled substance, an inhalant, or any combination of intoxicating liquor, inhalant and a controlled substance. ORS 813.010(1)(b)-(c). The state must allege any such theory in the charging instrument. ORS 813.010(2). 
</p><p>b. A person is considered under the influence of intoxicants if their physical and mental faculties are adversely affected to a noticeable or perceptible degree, regardless of their blood alcohol content. <i>See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Stroup,+147+Or+App+118,+%281997&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=8803079542427733321&amp;scilh=0">State v.

</p><p>c.The state may try and prove a defendant was under the influence of intoxicants by offering evidence of poor driving, officer observations upon contact with the defendant, performance on field sobriety tests, admissions made by the defendant, audio and/or video recordings, DRE interviews, breath or blood test results, and/or urinalysis.

<p>1. Driving under the influence cases are fairly straightforward to prepare and present. The state’s case must be based on logic and reason. If the case theory is not logical, it clearly will not rise to beyond a reasonable doubt. 
</p><p>2. The goal for the prosecution is to build a trusting relationship with the jury during jury selection and not overpromise facts that cannot be delivered during opening statement. The same is true for defense attorneys. However, for prosecutors, during the trial the focus should be on the witnesses. In my opinion, the best prosecutor directs the case but is unnoticed by the jury during his or her case in chief. The reasoning is simple: the jurors are going to figure out the prosecutor wasn’t there when the defendant was driving, pulled over, performing tests, back at the police station or hospital or for any part of the interviewing/investigating stage. Any attention placed on the prosecutor is a lost opportunity for focus on the witnesses. At the end of the case, the jury should be basing the verdict on the evidence. And the witnesses and exhibits provide the evidence.

The Five Sections of the Prosecution’s Case</span></h3>
<p>A prepared prosecutor breaks down a DUII case into five easy sections.
</p><p><b>1. Initial Tactical Decisions</b>
a.Is there reckless driving that could bring in prior DUIIs?
</p><p>b.Is there a way to get in the <i>Miles </i>instruction?
</p><p><b>2. Themes—Driving and Impaired</b> 
</p><p>a.The defendant was driving—no bad driving is required.
</p><p>b.Drunk driving is not the standard. Check out the uniform jury instructions regarding the definition of impairment. 
</p><p>c.Deciding to convict is hard for a jury. Therefore, the more emphasis on examining the actions rather than the person will make it easier for the jury to convict.
</p><p><b>3. Direct – Organizing the Evidence to Prove the Elements of DUII</b> 
</p><p>a.The experience of the officer—build credibility that is either corroborated by blood/breath test or put up against defendant’s refusal and willingness to take all the penalties with a refusal.
b.The driving observed, including how/where the defendant pulled over. 
c.The “informal field sobriety tests” or the personal contact between officer and defendant through initial screening before field sobriety tests.
d.The standardized field sobriety tests.
e.Inventory/transport/misc.
f. DUII interview. 
g.Observation/breath/blood test.
h.Prior treatment/diversion/conviction.

</p><p><b>4. Re-direct</b>
</p><p>After defense brings up the list of what is missing, get the case back to how those indicators aren’t needed as not everyone shows every sign.
</p><p><b>5. Cross-examination—don’t ruin closing argument material</b>
</p><p>a.Field tests—would they have been performed the same without alcohol in system?
b.Breath test—never asked for a breath test. Never said disagreed with the breath test. Never asked to take another test. 
c.Refusal—apparently license isn’t important. Took longer suspension period. Hiding something?

<p><b>DUII - A Person in a Motorized Wheelchair in a Crosswalk is a Pedestrian and Not a Driver</b>
The court concludes that defendant - who was intoxicated while operating his motorized wheelchair in a crosswalk - was entitled to a judgment of acquittal for DUII. The court agrees with defendant that at the time he was operating his wheelchair in a crosswalk, he was a pedestrian, not a driver subject to the vehicle code. The court acknowledges that the state's argument, that defendant's motorized wheelchair is a vehicle, is not without some merit. The vehicle expressly treats motorized vehicles as bicycles when they are operated in a bicycle lane or path. Accordingly, a person in a motorized wheelchair may be subject to DUII when operating in a bike lane. However, the vehicle code treats persons in wheelchairs as pedestrians for most other purposes and a person cannot be simultaneously a pedestrian and a driver. Therefore, when a person in a motorized wheelchair is traveling as a pedestrian in a crosswalk, he is not subject to DUII.

<p>Boating Under the Influence of Intoxicants is addressed in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/lawsstatutes/2013ors830.html">ORS 830.325</a>. Under that statute, no person may “operate, propel or be in actual physical control of any boat on any waters” of Oregon while “under the influence of an intoxicating liquor of controlled substance.” ORS 830.325(1). Additionally, “no owner of a boat or person in charge or in control of a boat shall authorize or knowingly permit the boat to be propelled or operated on any waters of this state by any person who is under the influence of an intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance.” <i>Id. </i>(2). 
</p><p>A “boat” is defined as “every description of watercraft, including a seaplane on the water and not in flight, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on the water, but does not include boathouses, floating homes, air mattresses, beach and water toys or single inner tubes.” ORS 830.005(2). <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Lambert,+227+Or+App+614+%282009&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=6595029803146133528&amp;scilh=0">State v.

</p><p>Under ORS 830.510(2), “not less than .08 percent of weight of alcohol in a person’s blood constitutes being under the influence of intoxicating liquor.” If it is shown by chemical analysis of breath or blood that the weight of alcohol was less than .08 percent, then it is “indirect evidence that may be used with other evidence, if any, to determine whether or not the person was under the influence of intoxicants.” ORS 830.510(1).

<p>Field sobriety tests as a component of BUII cases are often overlooked by both the police and defense attorneys. The National Association of State Boating Law Administrators (NASBLA), in a successful grant application to the U.S. Coast Guard, noted the following:
</p><p>A battery of SFSTs was validated for traffic enforcement over two decades ago and since has become accepted nationwide as a means of demonstrating probable cause to arrest suspected impaired drivers. However, no such definitive validation has ever been conducted for SFSTs used on suspected impaired boat operators. In fact, the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) field sobriety test is the only truly validated SFST that can be administered to BUI suspects by marine law enforcement officer while afloat. 
</p><p>Despite the lack of validation, many marine enforcement agencies routinely teach their officers to use these same highway-based SFSTs to screen boat operators, a purpose for which they were not validated. Over the course of the last 20 years literally thousands of BUI cases have been prosecuted using SFSTs designed and validated for use on highways, but borrowed as proxies for use on our waterways. Unfortunately, the primary battery of SFSTs approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHSTA) for use in highway traffic enforcement is based on the assessment of human motor skills linked to one’s sense of balance.
</p><p>The grant application is full of excellent information that illustrates the weaknesses in BUII prosecutions, especially with regard to the administration of field sobriety tests. NASBLA’s application recounts the history of studies conducted concerning field sobriety tests in a marine environment, concluding with a description of the research to date:
</p><p>In 1993, Dr. Marceline Burns (“A Study of Field Sobriety Tests in the Marine Environment”), of the Southern California Research Institute, conducted a preliminary study in an attempt to evaluate a number of accepted field sobriety tests and their use in a marine environment. The results of this study indicated the Rhomberg-type tests of subtraction and backward counting variations were not alcohol-sensitive enough for use as FSTs. Three tests showed significant promise as on-boat FST and were identified as the finger to nose, 30-second time estimation and the skip alphabet. As a note, horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) was also evaluated in the marine environment, but because it is neural and not vestibular in origin (vestibular impairment may include dizziness, imbalance, vertigo, nausea, and fuzzy vision), there were no perceived issues in its use as an on-boat FST. Recently, HGN was validated for both sitting and prone positions, thus increasing its validity as an on-boat predictor of alcohol use in the marine environment.
</p><p>In 2011, after a three-year study funded by the Coast Guard, NASBLA – along with the SCRI – validated four seated field sobriety tests for use afloat. Four seated tests have been approved for detection of impairment (defined as BAC greater than or equal to .08%: <i>horizontal gaze nystagmus; finger to nose; palm pat, and hand coordination.</i> 
</p><p>“<i>Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus</i> – The HGN test requires three separate checks, administered independently to each eye. Four or more clues indicate impairment due to BAC greater than or equal to .08%.
</p><p><i>Finger to Nose</i> – The FTN test requires the subject to bring the tip of the index finger to touch the tip of the nose. It is performed with eyes closed and head tilted slightly back. Nine or more clues indicate impairment due to BAC greater than or equal to .08%.
</p><p><i>The Palm Pat</i> –<i> </i>The PP test requires the subjects to place one hand extended, palm up, out in front of them. The other hand is placed on top of the first with the palm facing down. The top hand rotates 180 degrees and pats the bottom hand, alternating between the back of the hand and the palm of the hand. The bottom hand remains stationary. The subjects count out loud in relation with each pat. Two or more clues indicate impairment due to BAC greater than or equal to .08%. 
</p><p><i>The Hand Count</i> – The HC test requires the subjects to perform a series of tasks with their hands. It is very loosely adapted from the Walk-And-Turn test performed on land. Three or more clues indicate impairment due to BAC greater than or equal to .08%.”

</p><p>This application of the DUII statute to bikes implicates the standards that the state must meet in order to prove a DUII case; either a BAC of .08% or greater at the time of operation of the bicycle or that the bicyclist is under the influence of 1) intoxicating liquor, 2) a controlled substance, or 3) a combination of alcohol and a controlled substance such that the person’s physical or mental faculties are adversely affected by the intoxicants to a noticeable and perceptible degree.

<p>(1) Any person who operates a motor vehicle upon premises open to the public...shall be deemed to have given consent, subject to the implied consent law, to a chemical test of the person’s breath....
</p><p>By the very terms of the statute, implied consent does <i>not </i>apply to bicycles. If you receive a police report where the officer walks through the IC paperwork with your client then gets them to take the breath test, the client is entitled to suppression of the BAC results. <i>State v. Woodruff</i>, <i>supra</i>, makes this an express holding. <i>Id</i> at 487. 
</p><p>Even if you receive no IC paperwork in the police report, it is worth asking your client whether there were any threats or promises, express or veiled, made by the officer regarding adverse consequences of refusing a breath or blood test. Since IC does not apply to bicycles, there is no license sanction for refusing the breath/blood test.

<p>Regardless of the Implied Consent statute, an officer may still seek out a warrant for a blood draw. Many of the same issues that we encounter with motor vehicle DUIIs will arise:
</p><p>What did the officer swear to in their Affidavit in Support of Warrant?
Who drew the blood? 813.160(2) only allows a licensed physician or person working under the direction or control of a licensed physician to pierce human tissue.
Was an iodine or betadine swap used, as opposed to an alcohol swab?
Does the lab performing the test comport with 813.160?

<p><i>State v. Woodruff</i> lays the groundwork for the argument that if a statute refers to “vehicle,” it will apply to bicycles. See Reckless Driving <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/lawsstatutes/2013ors811.html">811.140</a>, “a person commits the offense of Reckless Driving if the person recklessly drives a <i>vehicle</i>...”(emphasis added). But if a statute refers to “motor vehicles,” the bicycles will not fall under the statute. See Implied Consent. 
</p><p>However, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Potter,+185+Or+App+81+%282002&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=11027246497969834870&amp;scilh=0">State v. Potter</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Potter,+185+Or+App+81+%282002&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=11027246497969834870&amp;scilh=0">, 185 Or App 81 (2002)</a>, raises a red flag as to the “vehicle” vs. “motor vehicle” distinction as used in the Vehicle Code. In <i>Potter</i> a bicyclist was convicted under 811.130 for impeding traffic. This particular statute states that “a person commits the offense of impeding traffic if the person drives a motor vehicle or a combination of motor vehicles in a manner that impedes or blocks the normal and reasonable movement of traffic.”
</p><p>The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s denial of the bicyclist’s Motion for Judgment of Acquittal on the grounds that 811.130 did apply to bicycles, express reference to motor vehicles in the statute notwithstanding. In reaching this conclusion the court relied on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/lawsstatutes/2013ors801.html">801.026(6)</a> and 814.400. 
</p><p>801.026 lays out a list of exemptions and exceptions to the vehicle code. Subsection (6) addresses bicycles:
“6) Devices that are powered exclusively by human power are not subject to those provisions of the vehicle code that relate to vehicles. Notwithstanding this subsection, bicycles are generally subject to the vehicle code as provided under ORS 814.400.” <i>See </i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Smith,+184+Or+App+118+%282002%29&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=16003909448037687770&amp;scilh=0">State v. Smith</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Smith,+184+Or+App+118+%282002%29&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=16003909448037687770&amp;scilh=0">, 184 Or App 118 (2002)</a> (a skateboard is not a vehicle within the meaning of ORS 811.140 (Reckless Driving)).
</p><p>After engaging in a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=PGE+v.+BOLI+&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=5450306107264830888&amp;scilh=0">PGE v. BOLI</a> analysis, the court concludes that, since 801.026(6) exempts non-motorized vehicles from the Vehicle Code except for bicycles as provided in 814.400, the exception spelled out in 814.400(2)(that 814.400 does not apply when otherwise provided under the Vehicle Code) would be rendered meaningless were the court to find that 811.130 did not apply to bikes without the legislature specifically exempting bicycles from the coverage of 811.130. 
</p><p>In other words, according to <i>Potter</i>, non-motorized vehicles are exempted from the vehicle code under 801.026(6) except for bicycles. In general, bikes fall under the vehicle code by way of 814.400(1), unless according to 814.400(1)(b) “otherwise specifically provided under the vehicle code.” <i>Potter </i>seems to hold that bicycles always fall under all provisions of the vehicle code unless a particular statute specifically says it does not apply to bicycles. 
</p><p>There is great conflict between <i>Potter </i>and <i>Woodruff</i>. Under the <i>Potter </i>reasoning, implied consent should apply to bicycles because it does not specifically exempt bicycles. Extending <i>Potter </i>to implied consent would lead to an absurd result because no operator’s license is necessary to ride a bicycle in Oregon, thus the implicit consent to take a breath test one gives to the state when they receive a driver’s license simply doesn’t exist when it comes to bicycles. 
</p><p>Should this issue come up, another angle of attack is 814.400(1)(a), which provides that the vehicle code applies to bicycles except for “those provisions which by their very nature can have no application.” This subsection was not argued in <i>Potter</i>. Arguably, a provision in the code that refers specifically to motor vehicles cannot by its very nature apply to bicycles. Presumably, the legislature knows what it is doing when it uses the more specific language of “motor vehicle” versus simply “vehicle” in any given provision in the vehicle code. 
</p><p>Permanent revocation of driving privileges of person convicted of felony while driving under influence of intoxicants or of multiple driving under influence of intoxicants offenses applies to person convicted of felony or offenses while operating bicycle under influence of intoxicants. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Abbey,+239+Or+App+306,+245+p3d+152+%282010%29&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=5701807464496455423&amp;scilh=0">State v.

<p>Was your client riding his bike on the sidewalk as opposed to in the street? The vehicle code only applies to those areas that are “premises open to the public.” Under 801.400, “premises open to the public” includes any premises open to the general public for the use of motor vehicles, whether the premises are publicly or privately owned and whether or not a fee is charged for the use of the premises. [1983 c.338 §§72]
</p><p>A sidewalk is not open for the use of motor vehicles; the code does not apply in that situation.

<p>How was you client doing on his bike before he got pulled over? Riding a bicycle requires not only a fair amount of physical coordination, but balance as well. It really is a test of divided attention and balance. Were they riding along just fine prior to being stopped for not having a light on their bike?
